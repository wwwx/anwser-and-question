                    If you don’t get accepted when you apply, don’t worry!
                    Sometimes it may take several attempts to qualify for a
                    loan. We encourage you to continue saving data on your phone
                    and to reapply after the period stipulated.

                    Late loan repayments automatically incur a fee of 2% per
                    day. It is therefore advised that one does not exceed the
                    due date. Repay the loan by its due date allows you to
                    access larger loan sizes. Late repayments will affect your
                    ability to get subsequent or larger loans. If you are very
                    late on your payments, we report to the Credit Reference
                    Bureau. Blacklisting by the Credit Reference Bureau may
                    affect your ability to borrow from other lenders.

                    Unfortunately, Tingo cannot alter your repayment plan after
                    you’ve received a loan. If you are unable to repay the full
                    amount due, we advise you to start making partial repayments
                    as soon as possible.
